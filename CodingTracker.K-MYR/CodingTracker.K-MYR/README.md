<h1> Habit Tracker </h1>

Easy-use console app to track your coding sessions. <br>

<h2>Use:</h2>
This program is straightforward designed to track your coding sessions. The user can freely add, update and delete sessions. 
Further, the user can create reports to get an overview of their achievements ("Show Report"). 
Furthermore the user can access a collection of all the sessions added ("Show All Records") or only those within a given timeframe ("Show Specific Records").
The user can also set, update and delete goals which will automatically track their progress.
By displaying all or only the currently running goals, the user can acess how many hours they have collected so far and how many are left to reach their goals (" Show All Coding Goals"/"Show Current Goals").

<h2> Pending Issues </h2>
-goals include the duration of a session fully even if the endtime of the session is past the deadline (instead of counting only the hours within); <br>
-improving readability by moving functions into separate classes
